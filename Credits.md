# Zend Developper Zone #

At the end of 2007  Rapyd libary was cited in a podcast of Zend developper zone,
about php, codeigniter and contributed code for Code Igniter (old rapyd library was a subframework of CI).
Special thanks to Ed Finkler, who explained also rapyd goals (unchanged in current stand alone release).
