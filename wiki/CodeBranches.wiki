= Make your own branch =
Project members "must" make custom branch using this command:
 
{{{
svn copy https://rapyd-framework.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ 
https://rapyd-framework.googlecode.com/svn/branches/nickname 
-m "Private branch for me" --username userame
}}}

You can choise "nickname" as desired, but "username" must be your google code username.
