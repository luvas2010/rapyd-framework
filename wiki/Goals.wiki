main goals:

  * be a stand-alone MVC application framework,  but preserve flexibility of a simple php library (if you need some parts only).
  * widget oriented architecture (grids, forms, tables, etc..)
  * ultraconcise syntax
  * be smart, few files, clean filesystem
  * include just few (and tiny) third party libs (nicEdit,jquery,some jquery plugin)
