main goals:


  * be a stand-alone HMVC application framework, 
but preserve flexibility, for integration with other software.
  * first: practical, so widget oriented architecture (grids, forms, tables, etc..) few line of code to make a feature. 
  * second: performances, run in 0.0x seconds is a must, so cache, compression..
  * ultraconcise syntax


in the end:

be smart, be cleaver, few files, clean filesystem.
