Rapyd framework has a "superclass" (like other mvc frameworks):

[http://code.google.com/p/rapyd-framework/source/browse/trunk/rapyd/libraries/rapyd.php rpd]

In the application flow, the superclass is used statically in the system gateway (the main index.php file which handle all request).

rpd class has all methods needed in a (minimalistic) mvc:

 * router (to detect current/requested uri)
 * controller (to instance the class that will perform actions to serve an uri request)
 * view (called by controller, it include/parse an output file, normally it's a simple php file with html tags and some echo).
