= rpd the superclass =

Basically rapyd framework has (like most mvc framework) a "superclass":

[http://code.google.com/p/rapyd-framework/source/browse/trunk/rapyd/libraries/rapyd.php rpd]

in the superclass we have the base of an mvc:

 * router (to detect current/requested uri)
 * controller (to instance the class that will perform actions to serve an uri request)
 * view (called from controller, to provide an output, normally it's a simple php file with html tags and some echo).
