= rpd the superclass =

Basically rapyd framework has (like most mvc framework) a "superclass":

[http://code.google.com/p/rapyd-framework/source/browse/trunk/rapyd/libraries/rapyd.php rpd]

in the superclass we have the base of an mvc:

* router (to detect current/requested uri)
* controller (to instance the class that will perform actions to serve an uri request)
* view (to provide a separation bw controller and output template, normally a simple php file with html and some echo).
