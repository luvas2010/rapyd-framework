Completed features have a strike through them.

0.8 planned

  * core rewrite, syntax should be "only" oop strict, and "entirely" chainable. (loose array syntax for a better and clean class inheritance).

  * better and full orm (object-relational mapping) try to follow kohana

  * build a cache (similar to CI, but with "partials" support), my idea is to cache a parsed view, but keep a non cached placeholders/subview {subview}..

  * ~~i must learn a bit more about "hmvc", try to take inspiration from kohana if possible.~~

  * controller, router, view. must be stand alone classes, not rpd methods. and like CI/kohana each core class must have an extended empty class so (rapyd_ prefix must be reserved for core classes)



0.7 under dev.

  * ~~new site, built on current svn..~~ i'm sorry for old forum, probably i've lost all recent backups.
 
  * ~~fix to keep CI compatibility and to cleanup syntax~~

  * ~~add postgres driver by tannoiser~~

  * ~~demos driven by flat-file sqlite3 database~~

0.6

  * ~~core rewrite, syntax will be more oop strict, but we will do our best to keep "configuration arrays" as an alternative way to describe widgets.~~

 * ~~documentation~~


0.5

  * ~~new release to fix urgent stuffs (master detail demo debug, new drivers for pdo/sqlite)~~


0.4

  * ~~modules support~~

  * ~~class autoloader~~
