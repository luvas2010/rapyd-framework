Completed features have a strike through them.

1.0 

  * core rewrite, syntax should be "only" oop strict, and "entirely" chainable. (loose array syntax for a better and clean class inheritance).

  * better and full orm (object-relational mapping) try to follow kohana

  * controller, router, view. must be stand alone classes, not rpd methods. and like CI/kohana each core class must have an extended empty class so (rapyd_ prefix must be reserved for core classes)


0.9  under dev.

  * test cache with new uri-architecture

  * clean a bit new class datachart, build 2 samples: simple and filtered based.

  * build hooks system, pre-system / pre-controller / post-controller / post-system
    (for example, i need a pre-system call to do modules-stuffs like attach sqllite-db)

  * build "blog module", in future rapyd will be more cms-ready.



0.8

  *  ~~upgrade jquery version, nicedit (or replace nicedit with anoter wysiwyg based on jquery) ~~

  * ~~benchmark (timestamp, memory usage)~~

  * ~~build a cache (similar to CI, but with "partials" support), my idea is to cache a parsed view~~, but keep a non cached placeholders/subview {subview}..

  * ~~i must learn a bit more about "hmvc", try to take inspiration from kohana if possible.~~

  * (postponed) controller, router, view. must be stand alone classes, not rpd methods. and like CI/kohana each core class must have an extended empty class so (rapyd_ prefix must be reserved for core classes)



0.7 

  * ~~new site, built on current svn..~~ i'm sorry for old forum, probably i've lost all recent backups.
 
  * ~~fix to keep CI compatibility and to cleanup syntax~~

  * ~~add postgres driver by tannoiser~~

  * ~~demos driven by flat-file sqlite3 database~~

0.6

  * ~~core rewrite, syntax will be more oop strict, but we will do our best to keep "configuration arrays" as an alternative way to describe widgets.~~
