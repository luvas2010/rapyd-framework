Completed features have a strike through them.

0.8 
  * core rewrite, syntax should be "only" oop strict, and "entirely" chainable. (loose array syntax for a better and clean class inheritance)

0.7

  * new site, built on current svn.. i'm sorry for old forum, probably i've lost all recent backups.
 
  * new release with  flatsql, better windows compatibility, and postgres driver by tannoiser (already on current trunk),

  * demos driven by flatsql (so no mysql installation, and no dump required to run samples, just download, unzip and run)

0.6

  * ~~core rewrite, syntax will be more oop strict, but we will do our best to keep "configuration arrays" as an alternative way to describe widgets.~~
