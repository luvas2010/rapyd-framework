Completed features have a strike through them.

0.8 

  * core rewrite, syntax should be "only" oop strict, and "entirely" chainable. (loose array syntax for a better and clean class inheritance).

  * better and full orm (object-relational mapping) try to follow kohana

  * build a cache (similar to CI, but with "partials" support), my idea is to cache a parsed view, but keep a non cached placeholders/subview {subview}..
  i must learn a bit more about "hmvc", try to take inspiration from kohana if possible.


0.7

  * new site, built on current svn.. i'm sorry for old forum, probably i've lost all recent backups.
 
  * new release with  flatsql, better windows compatibility, and postgres driver by tannoiser (already on current trunk),

  * demos driven by flatsql (so no mysql installation, and no dump required to run samples, just download, unzip and run)

  * ~~core rewrite, syntax will be more oop strict, but we will do our best to keep "configuration arrays" as an alternative way to describe widgets.~~
