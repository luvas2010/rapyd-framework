Hi all rapyd guys, 
this is the 1.0 version, and is planned for (2011-08-25)
don't know yet if it will be released in bundle with cms

this software is open source, it include some LGPL third party libraries, so rapyd-framework license is LGPL too (no more MIT)

DEPLOY:

- unzip if possible on your document root 
- you need only php5.1+ and sqlite3-pdo (to run demo module)

WRITABLE:

you should make writable:
- application/db (if you will use sqlite3 as db-driver)

- modules/demo/db (if you will run demos, built on sqlite3)
- uploads (suggested as repository of application uploaded files)
- cache (if you need file cache)


CONFIGURATION POSSIBILITIES:

- by default rapyd-framework is configured to run in the document root folder
if you run it "inside a folder" instead of deploing root level you need to:
- edit /application/config.php  and set $config['basename'] = "/folder/";  (with both slashes)


you can omitt "index.php" in urls if you can use apache+mod_rewrite:
- edit /application/config.php  and set $config['index_page'] = ""; 
- edit .htaccess and set RewriteBase /folder/ (or / if the framework is in the document root)
(remember that all rows on .htaccess are commented, remove #  to enable rewrite)


CHANGELOG:

- readme added (as for cms branch), needed to add this changelog to the zip
- auth library, alignment from cms (check_role added)
- cache, found a great solution to support "partials", I'll explain more on rapyd.com (blog and forum)
- performance improvement, some "statics" added, and basically if you use cache with some non-cached partials and few queries, rapyd will compile output in 0.02/0.03 seconds :)
- output_compression possible, just set up  level [0-9] of gzip on config.php (require zlib enabled)
- bugfix on url->remove_all(), validation captcha, pagination, etc..
- {time} {memory} now display the exact amount (even with cached content), now I use a custom shutdown-function.. more on rapyd.com
