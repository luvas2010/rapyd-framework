This software is open source, released under LGPL 3 (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html)


DEPLOY:

- unzip if possible on your document root 
- you need only php5.2+ and sqlite3-pdo (to run demo module)

WRITABLE:

you should make writable:
- /application/db (if you will use sqlite3 as db-driver)

- /modules/demo/db (if you will run demos, built on sqlite3)
- /uploads (suggested as repository of application uploaded files)
- /cache (if you need file cache)


CONFIGURATION POSSIBILITIES:

- by default rapyd-framework is configured to run in the document root folder
if you run it "inside a folder" instead of deploing root level you need to:
- edit /application/config.php  and set $config['basename'] = "/folder/";  (with both slashes)


you can omitt "index.php" in urls if you can use apache+mod_rewrite:
- edit /application/config.php  and set $config['index_page'] = ""; 
- edit .htaccess and set RewriteBase /folder/ (or / if the framework is in the document root)
(remember that all rows on .htaccess are commented, remove #  to enable url rewrite)


CHANGELOG:

- license now LGPL3
- new samples: sql, mvc, hmvc, etc..
- runtime language switch support, now uri like /{lang}/controller/method is supported to drive language switch
- fixes on language runtime switch


Feedbacks, suggestions, collaborations, donations  are all welcome.
